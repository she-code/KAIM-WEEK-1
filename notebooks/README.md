**Purpose**:  
Performs a full pipeline of **text preprocessing**, **topic modeling**, and **publisher-based analysis** for financial news headlines. It aims to extract key financial themes (e.g., earnings reports, analyst coverage) and assess how different publishers specialize in certain types of news.

**Key Tasks Covered**:

- ‚úÖ **Text Cleaning**  
  Custom financial stopwords, lemmatization, and retention of relevant symbols like `$` and `%`.

- ‚úÖ **TF-IDF Keyword Extraction**  
  Identifies the top 2‚Äì3 word phrases across all headlines using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF).

- ‚úÖ **Topic Modeling (LDA)**  
  Implements Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover hidden topics within financial headlines.

- ‚úÖ **Topic Labeling**  
  Manually interprets and labels topics with meaningful descriptions (e.g., ‚ÄúAnalyst Coverage & Price Targets‚Äù).

- ‚úÖ **Publisher Specialization Analysis**  
  Quantifies how much each publisher contributes to each topic, revealing specialization patterns.
